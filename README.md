**Feasto** is a geospatial, full-stack surplus food redistribution platform designed to bridge the gap between food donors (restaurants, banquet halls, caterers, individuals) and local organizations in need (NGOs, shelters, community kitchens). 

By leveraging **geofencing** and hyper-local matching logic, Feasto ensures that excess edible food is dynamically routed, safely transported, and delivered to recipients within its critical safe consumption window.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Geospatial & Geofenced Matching:** Automatically pairs food donors with the closest active NGOs and volunteers using location-based APIs, drastically minimizing transit times.
- **Real-Time Food Listings:** Allows donors to quickly post excess food details including cuisine type, portion sizes, dietary markers, pickup instructions, and dynamic expiry timelines.
- **Interactive Claim System:** NGOs and verified shelters receive immediate alerts for nearby listings and can claim them instantaneously.
- **Logistics & Status Tracking:** Live status lifecycle updates (`Available` ➔ `Claimed` ➔ `In Transit` ➔ `Delivered`) for transparent food handling operations.
- **Impact Analytics Dashboard:** Tracks analytics regarding total food rescued (in kilograms/meals) and carbon footprint offset for both donors and NGOs.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Project Structure

Feasto uses a clean decoupled architecture split into a client-side frontend and a server-side backend.

## 🚦 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed (v16.x or higher recommended)
* [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account or local MongoDB instance running

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/feasto.git](https://github.com/yourusername/feasto.git)
cd feasto

```


2. **Set up the Backend Server:**
```bash
cd server
npm install

```


Create a `.env` file in the root of the `server/` directory and configure your variables:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
GEO_API_KEY=your_google_maps_or_location_api_key

```


Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run dev   # Runs via nodemon if configured, or use 'node server.js'

```


3. **Set up the Frontend Client:**
```bash
cd ../client
npm install

```


Create a `.env` file in the root of the `client/` directory:
```env
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
REACT_APP_MAP_API_KEY=your_frontend_map_api_key

```


Start the development server:
```bash
npm start

```



The application will now be running at `http://localhost:3000` with the backend operating concurrently at `http://localhost:5000`.

## 📍 API Endpoints (Quick Overview)

### Auth Routes (`/api/auth`)

* `POST /register` - Register a new User (Donor, NGO, or Volunteer)
* `POST /login` - User Authentication & token generation

### Food Listing Routes (`/api/food`)

* `POST /create` - Create a new food listing (Donors only)
* `GET /nearby` - Fetch listings within a specific geofenced radius using MongoDB `$near` query
* `PUT /claim/:id` - Claim a specific food listing (NGOs/Volunteers only)
* `PATCH /status/:id` - Update the active handling state of the donation

## 🌍 Impact & Objective

Food waste is responsible for roughly 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions while millions face food insecurity. **Feasto** addresses this systemic logistical disconnect by embedding technology into charity networks, ensuring that quality food reaches hungry individuals instead of landfill sites.
